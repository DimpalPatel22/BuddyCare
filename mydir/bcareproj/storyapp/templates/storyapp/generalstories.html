    <h3>Morning Surprise</h3>
    <p>
      I was walking to my favorite coffee shop early one morning, still half-asleep, when I noticed a tiny kitten shivering beside a trash can. Its little paws were soaked, and it looked so scared.<br><br>
      Without thinking, I wrapped it in my scarf and held it close. It purred instantly and nuzzled my neck. I ended up sitting on a bench for half an hour, just watching it explore my scarf and gently paw at my fingers.<br><br>
      It was such a small encounter, but it reminded me how fragile lives are and how little kindness can make someone feel safe. I left the kitten near a neighbor who often feeds strays, feeling like I’d made a difference in that tiny life.

    <h3>Lost but Found</h3>
    <p>
      Yesterday evening, my neighbor’s golden retriever, Max, ran out of the yard while we were playing fetch. Panic set in immediately — Max is friendly but curious, and the streets nearby are busy.<br><br>
      I spent hours walking around the neighborhood, calling his name and putting up posters. I even asked strangers if they’d seen him, feeling like time was slipping away.<br><br>
      Just when I was about to give up hope, someone spotted him in the park across the street. Max was safe, wagging his tail and happily greeting everyone. I couldn’t stop laughing and crying at the same time. That night, I realized how important community effort is — sometimes it takes more than one person to save a life.

    <h3>My Feathered Friends</h3>
    <p>
      Every morning, I place a small bowl of grains on my balcony for the sparrows. At first, they would hesitate and fly away as soon as I opened the door. But day by day, they started noticing me.<br><br>
      Now, as soon as I appear in the morning, a small flock gathers and chirps in excitement. Some even land on the balcony railing while I refill the grains. Watching them trust me over weeks has been strangely comforting — a reminder that consistency and care build bonds, even with tiny creatures.<br><br>
      Feeding these little birds has become part of my daily meditation. I never thought a few sparrows could teach me patience, observation, and joy, but they do.

    <h3>The Gentle Giant</h3>
    <p>
      On my way back from college, I often pass by a small group of cows resting near a temple. 
      One evening, I carried a few bananas with me and hesitated before offering one to the calmest cow sitting at the edge. 
      To my surprise, she stretched her head forward gently, as if she’d been waiting for me all along.<br><br>
      She ate slowly, then nudged my hand softly, her large eyes calm and peaceful. 
      A few passersby stopped and smiled at the scene, and I found myself laughing too. 
      It was such a simple moment, but it filled my heart with warmth.<br><br>
      Sometimes, joy is hidden in the quietest corners of our day — like feeding a gentle cow who only wanted a little attention.
