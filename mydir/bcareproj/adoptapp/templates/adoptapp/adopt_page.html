                    <h3>Simba</h3>
                    <p>
                        Simba was once a frightened stray pup roaming the busy streets of Pune. 
                        Malnourished and shy, he was rescued by BuddyCare volunteers. 
                        After weeks of care and love, Simba’s playful spirit returned. 
                        Today, he enjoys evening walks, cozy naps, and endless cuddles in his new home. 
                        From a lonely street to a joyful family dog – Simba’s journey is pure happiness!

                    <p>
                        Luna was found as a tiny kitten abandoned near a market. 
                        Weak and scared, she was fostered with warmth until she found the perfect family. 
                        Now, Luna spends her days chasing toy balls, curling up on laps, 
                        and purring her way into everyone’s heart. 
                        She went from abandoned to adored – Luna is living her dream life!

                        Kiwi, a little pigeon, was rescued after being injured during a kite festival. 
                        With timely treatment and gentle care, she regained her strength. 
                        Today, Kiwi brings joy with her cheerful chirps and playful whistles, 
                        filling her new family’s home with love and music. 
                        Her story reminds us that even the smallest wings deserve a chance to heal and fly again.

                        Not every bond is about adoption – sometimes it’s about pure friendship. 
                        Every evening when I return home, a street dog waits at the corner, wagging his tail with excitement. 
                        He doesn’t need words, just a pat on the head and a smile to know he’s loved. 
                        This unspoken bond reminds us that animals don’t just need homes – they also need hearts that care. 
                        He is not “my pet”, but truly my best friend on the streets.

                    <h3>Baa’s Gathiya Friend</h3>
                    <p>
                        This story is close to my heart because it belongs to my Baa (grandmother).  
                        Every afternoon during lunchtime, a crow would visit our home and patiently wait for his treat – 
                        a piece of <em>gathiya</em>, the crunchy Gujarati snack my Baa loved to share.  
                        The moment she stepped out with food, the crow would caw joyfully, almost as if saying “thank you.”  
                        Over time, it became a daily ritual – a bond of love, trust, and silent understanding.  
                        For Baa, that crow was never just a bird; he was a part of our family.

                🥗 Nutrition First
            </div>
            <div class="tip-back">
                Feed age-appropriate pet food and keep clean water always available. 
                Avoid harmful items like chocolate, onions, grapes or spicy food, and stick to vet-approved meals and safe treats.

            <div class="tip-front">
                🩺 Vet Visits
            </div>
            <div class="tip-back">
                Take your pet for an initial health check, vaccinations and deworming. 
                Puppies and kittens need frequent visits, while adult pets usually require yearly boosters to stay healthy.

                🎾 Playtime & Training
            </div>
            <div class="tip-back">
                Give daily exercise through walks or games like fetch to prevent boredom. 
                Teach basic commands such as sit or stay using treats and love, never punishment.

                🏡 Safe Space
            </div>
            <div class="tip-back">
                Provide a cozy resting spot like a bed or mat in a quiet corner. 
                This space helps pets feel secure, especially when guests come or loud noises scare them.

                Allow your pet time to adjust to their new home. 
                A rescued dog may hide at first, but with gentle words, routine, and small treats, trust and love will grow naturally.
