        <p>
          Sometimes, goats get trapped in wires or kittens hide inside car engines. 
          In such cases, never try forceful removal. Wait for volunteers, 
          guide them clearly, and keep curious bystanders at a safe distance.

        <p>
          Sometimes sparrows fall while flying or from trees. Never pour water directly into its beak ‚Äî it can choke and die.  
          Instead, use a small spoon, dropper, or wet your finger to let the bird sip slowly.  
          Place it in a quiet, shaded spot and wait for volunteers to help.

            <h3>Dogs Taste Love, Not Just Food</h3>
            <p>
                Dogs have about 1,700 taste buds, fewer than humans, but they are surprisingly sensitive to flavors and even emotions.  
                Studies show that when dogs eat, they respond not just to the food but also to the care and attention they receive.  
                A gentle pat or kind voice can make their meal feel more enjoyable than the food itself!

                On a sunny city corner, a pigeon stared at its reflection for minutes. 
                Pigeons can recognize themselves in mirrors and even remember faces. 
                They might be thinking about food, friends, or the next clever move.

                A young boy rescued a tiny goat that had been separated from its mother. 
                Goats are curious and playful creatures, full of energy and affection. 
                Little things like a gentle pat or a warm hug make them feel safe.
