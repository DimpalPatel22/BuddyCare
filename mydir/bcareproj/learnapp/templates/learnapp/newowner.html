    <h2>First-Time Pet Owner Guidance</h2>
    <p class="intro">
      Becoming a pet parent for the very first time is exciting, a little scary, but mostly full of love. 
      Don’t worry — BuddyCare is here to walk with you step by step. Let’s make this journey fun for both you and your furry friend. 
    </p>

    <div class="guide-content">
      <h3>1. Get Your Home Ready</h3>
      <p>
        Think of it as welcoming a baby — pets need a safe, cozy spot too.  
        Clear away wires, chemicals, or sharp things they might chew.  
        Keep fresh water, food bowls, and a soft place(bed,mat,crate) ready before they arrive. 
        Trust us, your pet will feel at home faster!
      </p>

      <h3>2. Food & Treats </h3>
      <p>
        Every pet’s tummy is different! Puppies, kittens, or adult pets need the right diet.  
        Avoid chocolates, grapes, or spicy food (they can harm your buddy).  
        Stick to safe pet food, and remember: a few healthy treats = happy wagging tail!
      </p>

      <h3>3. First Vet Visit</h3>
      <p>
        Just like kids need doctors, pets need their vet.  
        Take your buddy for a checkup within the first week. Vaccines, deworming, and health advice now will save you from bigger worries later.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Play, Walk, Repeat</h3>
      <p>
        Pets are bundles of energy! Daily walks, games like fetch, or even indoor toy time keep them fit and cheerful.  
        A tired pet = a happy pet .
      </p>

      <h3>5. Grooming is Caring </h3>
      <p>
        Bathing, brushing, nail trimming — it’s not just about looks.  
        Grooming keeps your pet healthy, reduces shedding, and makes cuddle-time more fun.  
        Plus, they secretly enjoy the pampering.
      </p>

      <h3>6. Teach & Bond</h3>
      <p>
        Start small — “sit,” “stay,” or “come.”  
        Use treats and lots of praise. Training isn’t only about discipline; it’s about building trust and friendship.  
        Your pet will see you not just as an owner, but as their best friend. 
      </p>

      <h3>7. Love, Patience & Understanding</h3>
      <p>
        Every pet is unique. Some learn fast, some take time.  
        There will be accidents, chewed shoes, and late-night barking.  
        But remember — patience, kindness, and love are the real keys to being the best pet parent.  
        And in return, you’ll get unconditional love like never before.
